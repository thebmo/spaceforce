01:28 | Robert > That's so, uh, I guess...
01:28  > Robert checks cynicism meter
01:28 | Robert > ... Inspiring I guess.

01:30 | Robert > And Romney won the Utah GOP primary
01:30 | Robert > lol
01:36 | Robert > So two dyed-in-the-wool Trump haters practically guaranteed heading to Congress, and different branches too!
08:54 | Lauren > I didn't because it was getting late, but I'm definitely going over to check today
08:59 | Lauren > https://gyazo.com/2650e8aa3fae58581b07c3dd359ca1b3 this is the most confusing gender reveal ever. is the cow pregnant, or the mom? or even the child?
09:08 | jareds > did fred move away yet?
09:09 |-INFO > missah [~mxie@2604:a880:800:10::335:a001] has quit [Quit: WeeChat 1.4]
09:09 | jareds > MISSAH NO
09:09 | Lauren > oh no
09:09 | jareds > I never confessed my love..
09:09 | Lauren > I'm sure she could feel it.
09:09 | jareds > Maybe this is the final straw that catalyzes my career as a writer.
09:10 |-INFO > missah [~mxie@2604:a880:800:10::335:a001] has joined #wtpa
09:10 | jareds > Oh nevermind.
09:10  > missah scratches head
09:11 | Lauren > how many straws do you NEED
09:11 | Lauren > you've had plenty!
09:20 | missah > I finally gathered up the courage to contact another company about their software engineering position
09:21 | missah > I considered filling out their application but because I've connected with their recruiter before, I figured it'd be smarter to reach out to her instead?
09:21 | missah > they build products for education :)
09:21 | missah > (I think I want to get into the EdTech space)
09:26 | Lauren > is that a thing, contacting them but not actually applying? 
09:27 | Lauren > I don't get what the benefit would be
09:28 | missah > it _can_ be a benefit
09:28 | missah > sometimes they just end up telling/encouraging you to apply through their system
09:28 | missah > but other times, you might get put through the process a little faster
09:29 | missah > so far, I haven't filled out a single application yet
09:29 | missah > and I'm going for 3 different positions (one is internal, but still)
09:29 | Lauren > this... is making me feel even more like i will never find another job
09:30 | missah > with the former scenario, at the very least, I'd be able to learn more about the company and what it's like by talking to that person. it may or may not encourage me to actually apply
09:31 | missah > I also often talk to people about where they work, regardless of whether or not I'm interested in their company
09:31 | missah > just good insight
09:32 | Lauren > is this the sort of thing that is actually becoming common, or is it one of those things I'm thinking way too much about and not having the sort of personality that lends itself to doing this wouldn't actually doom me
09:32 | missah > which part (is common)?
09:33 | Lauren > this whole entire thing you're talking about
09:33 | missah > oh
09:34 | missah > I'm honestly not sure
09:34 | Lauren > like I dunno, am I going to have to worry that if I just apply somewhere they'll be like well we like you but we're going with this person who contacted us before applying instead because we just really like their initiative
09:35 | Lauren > or not even get back to me at all because so many people have reached out first
09:35 | missah > my "ins" have been from being involved with the community as a leader, so there are some side benefits (like having connections) that come out of that
09:35 | missah > nah
09:35 | missah > they can't really do that (if they do things right)
09:35 | missah > because that'd be bias
09:35 | missah > well, let me rephrase
09:35 | Lauren > also, having literally zero ins. unless I can bel ike, well, I KNOW someone who is involved with the tech commnunity as a leader does that count
09:37 | missah > companies will generally prioritize candidates who look more promising (on paper or not). it's otherwise still first come, first serve as far as processing the queue
09:38 | missah > and for companies who are trying to minimize unconscious bias, they've been making efforts to remove PII from applications (though still storing internally)
09:39 | Lauren > but if you get in by not actually applying and just talking to someone, how can they even do that
09:39 | missah > so that the hiring team can't make judgements based on a person's name, the schools they went to, or the companies they've worked for in that past. because that can all contribute to implicit bias
09:39 | missah > sometimes they start anonymizing later in the process
09:39 | missah > or in different parts
09:39 | Lauren > my brain hurts
09:39 | missah > sorry :(
09:39  > Lauren never gets a new job
09:40 | missah > for example, for github, only the recruiter knows my info and how well I did on stuff. everyone else who evaluates my stuff don't know whose technical exercises they're reviewing and stuff
09:40 | Lauren > ah okay I guess I see
09:40 | Lauren > so it's not like, there isn't a single person who knows those things
09:40 | missah > I think if you have enough motivation (and support), you'd be able to find a new job
09:40 | missah > but it seems like you're pretty comfortable
09:41 | Lauren > I THINK I am but I don't trust that, because I also know I'm extremely uncomfortable with the thought of getting a new job
09:41 | missah > I am too :(
09:41 | missah > I haven't even finished updating my resume
09:41 | missah > and cover letters still make me uncomfortable
09:41 | Lauren > yeah I hate cover letters
09:41 | missah > and I'm afraid that I'm the only blocker to my own happiness
09:41 | jareds > Yeah cover letters are gross.
09:41 | Lauren > I got robert to write one for me once
09:42 | missah > like what if the perfect job required a cover letter!?
09:42 | Lauren > but it didn't feel like me. but I don't think ANY cover letter would feel like me
09:42 | Lauren > yeah
09:42 | jareds > Then you would write that letter!
09:42 | Lauren > also this
09:42 | Lauren > [09:41] missah and I'm afraid that I'm the only blocker to my own happiness
09:42 | Lauren > missaH+++++
09:42 | missah > but also, as someone who's been on the hiring team before, IDGAF about cover letters
09:42 | jareds > I always put weird stuff in my cover letters, like that I love Pokemon.
09:42 | Lauren > i haven't been but i know that i don't even want to look at resumes so a cover letter ugh
09:42 | missah > yeah exactly
09:43 | jareds > Or that new chocolate pokemon, Cocomon.
09:43 | missah > if someone provides a cover letter, I _might_ read it if I'm on the fence about them
09:43 | Lauren > or if i hate them, and want to get on irc to complain and trash them
09:43 | Lauren > but maybe HR people really love reading cover letters or something, and it's only engineers who hate it
09:44 | jareds > I have a feeling that my skills, on a resume, are skills people would look at and say "meh."
09:44 | missah > yeah, it all depends on who the stuff goes through 
09:44 | Lauren > i wish cover letters weren't expected to be formal, so I could like, write it the way I'd actually talk
09:44 | missah > my Dev Director has admitted to not even reading resumes
09:44 | Lauren > haha
09:44 | missah > see, that's why I'd rather meet with someone who actually works there _first_
09:44 | jareds > They'd be like, "Oh, Jared Stander? This guy sounds like an asshole, let's bring him in and then tell him we're never hiring him."
09:45 | missah > I'm so much better at talking in person about stuff than writing it all down
09:45 | missah > I think I sound much more passionate about shit when you actually hear it from my voice than when it's written down
09:45 | missah > jareds: :(
09:45 | Lauren > I just want to be able to be like, listen, I think that I am good at my current job, but there are all these things that come up in interviews that literally have never come up in jobs before and I am stressed out 
09:45 | jareds > Yeah that's probably true.
09:45 | Lauren > yeah, plus people who are trying to see if you're passionate about a thing could like... draw it out of you more
09:46 | missah > Lauren: I highly highly recommend that you start attending some tech events
09:46 | jareds > Companies probably use resumes and cvs wrong, but whatever.
09:46 | Lauren > rather than you having to just come up with stuff out of nowhere
09:46 | Lauren > they just sound so boring :(
09:46 | missah > I've met a lot of friends and connected with many companies this way
09:46 | missah > it's a great social and professional thing!
09:46 | missah > are you in WWCode?
09:46 | Lauren > yeah I think so
09:47 | missah > you could try a Tech Talks & Social Night event
09:47 | missah > those are more low key
09:47 | missah > the tech talks are usually lightning talks, so at least they're short
09:47 | missah > those happening monthly
09:47 | Lauren > and I know you've talked about how they're not all, as I always assumed, just people going on about the ~latest tech stuff~ and that's it
09:47 | missah > I've taken a step back from organizing WWCode events for the summer, but I can still attend one of two with you if you find one you're interested in
09:47 | Lauren > maybe going to the planner thing saturday will make me feel better about tech things
09:48 | missah > I think we're doing another resume workshop soon, but more focused on the visual side
09:48 | Lauren > related WHY CAN'T RESUMES IN TECH BE AS PRETTY AS ARCHITECT ONES
09:49 | Lauren > or like, wedding invites. 
09:50 | Lauren > replace cover letters with a wedding invite kind of thing. YOU'RE INVITED... TO INTERVIEW ME
09:50 | Lauren > date and time: up to you!
09:50 | Lauren > location: your office!
09:51 | Lauren > really just incorporate anything that would show the person's actual personality at all
09:55 | Lauren > or the resume could just be a wedding website?
09:55 | Lauren > i just want opportunities to do wedding things for myself without actually needing to get married
09:57 | missah > yay!! the recruiter I contacted agreed to coffee! :D
09:57 | Lauren > well now I want to be a recruiter, if my job can be to go have coffee with people
09:57 | missah > your resume should totally reflect who you are!
09:58 | Lauren > Hobbies: Planners, Getting the most steps, Worrying about being bad at tech interviews
09:59 | Lauren > maybe I can make two versions of my resume- one that is the dry traditional sort, and one that is more "me" and then put both on my website
10:01 | Lauren > actually that could even just be good practice, cover letters too- write what I'd actually like to say
10:02 | missah > heh, my coworker's condo in East Cambridge has been sold
10:03 | missah > it's been 1 weekend
10:03 | Lauren > wow
10:03 | missah > ~~Boston area~~
10:03 | Lauren > yeah that sounds right lol
10:03  > Lauren crosses fingers for another housing crash
10:03 | missah > re: resumes - some people really do have different versions of their resumes created
10:03 | missah > usually catered towards whatever company or position they're going for
10:03 | Lauren > yeah I've heard about that
10:04 | Lauren > like if your'e good at multiple languages, have one with more of a focus on ruby for the ruby job, or whatever
10:04 | missah > but also, as part of that resume workshop I ran, one of the things we do as an exercise is have people write down everything they can think of
10:04 | missah > and then we do curating later
10:04 | missah > and then we do rephrasing and such
10:04 | Lauren > okay that does sound fun
10:04 | missah > so I think your plan sounds reasonable :P
10:04 | Lauren > thank you for the inspiration!
10:04 | missah > you're welcome!
10:05 | missah > I think Dickie said he has multiple versions of his resume
10:13 | Lauren > someone said something in a dev meeting just now that made me realize that a big contributor to my lack of interest in spending time learning about new tech stuff is that here we're basically discouraged from ever using any of it
10:14 | missah > that's tough :(
10:14 | missah > on the flip side, some companies encourage it too much?
10:15 | Lauren > yeah true...
10:15 | Lauren > the SOPs and FDA regulations just make it so hard to ever make changes beyond what is absolutely the most vital
10:15 | missah > yeah, I bet
10:15 | Lauren > even things that would make a lot of vital work way easier going forward
10:16 | Lauren > like we're still on android 5.x. that shit is 4 years old!
10:16 | tduds > missah: Lauren I caught part of this on the way home last night, you might enjoy: https://www.npr.org/2018/06/26/623583302/women-in-tech-is-there-a-wave-coming
10:16 | juju > https://goo.gl/SWp14R
10:17 | Lauren > and if I look into what's in newer versions of the API, or even just new versions of plugins we use, it's just going to annoy me
10:17 | Lauren > oo i will read this after my meeting
10:20 | missah > bookmarking!
10:21 | Lauren > er, listen, maybe i will save it for later then
10:36 | Robert > Is Slack working for anyone?
10:36 | missah > nope
10:36 | missah > https://status.slack.com/
10:36 | Robert > Well all right then
10:43 | Lauren > yep
10:43 | Lauren > ironically I got an email from them dring this broken time
10:43 | Lauren > Help us improve Slack by taking this survey
10:43 | Robert > ha
10:45 | Lauren > but yeah it sotpped working for me at like 9:20
10:45 | Lauren > coincidentally my wifi broke at the same time
10:46 | Lauren > OMG WE MIGHT GET TO USE GIT
10:46  > Lauren praises all the gods of all the religions
10:48 |@chewer > ms bought them so now its legit and not used by just hacker bros
10:49 | Lauren > they just bought github, really
10:49 | Lauren > not git itself
10:49 | Lauren > what we'd use is gitlab which is an enterprise thing
10:49 |@chewer > o i didnt know they were 2 different things LOL
10:56 | Robert > all sorts of gits floating around
10:57 | Robert > bitbucket's another one
10:57 | Lauren > and "go on, git"
10:57 | Robert > right
11:04 | Lauren > bitbucket reminds me of how when New Guy joined, he was like, oh wow accurev is terrible! we should really be using bitbucket.
11:04 | Lauren > and I laughed and laughed to myself about how he thought it would be so easy to just switch
11:05 | Robert > lol
11:05 | Lauren > YEAH NEW GUY THAT IS A GREAT IDEA IDK WHY WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT SOONER
11:06 | Robert > "Sure, if you want to go ahead and take the helm on that massive, complicated, probably endlessly long process you go right ahead, new guy."
11:08 | Lauren > anyway now Annoying Guy doesn't know how to merge even though I told him what to do.
11:17 | tduds > it's just every other car what's so hard
11:17 | Lauren > oh my fucking god
11:18 | Lauren > it turns out he did know what to do he just didn't realize you have to actually promote the code omg how is he this dumb

11:22 | Robert > Well I almost had a heart attack. I thought I had fucked up and failed to put a meeting with a sponsor on the calendar, but what actually happened is they didn't take time zones into consideration when they put it on their calendar.
11:23 | tduds > pesky globe
11:26 | Robert > Ugh, we have to have the AC cranked so that facilities can isolate a leak. Fuckin freezin in here
11:26  > Robert opens a window
11:27 | jareds > Yeah, new technology is most just a headache. Client sees some new, but completely unsupported by most browsers except for onw, thing and they want it. And we have to be like, "Yeah you can't use this, none of your users will be able to see it."
11:27 | jareds > Or, you know.... they all use IE for some reason.
11:27 | jareds > Fucking IE man.

12:36 | Robert > lol
12:36 | Robert > Wow, Crowley has been really gracious in defeat.
12:36 | Robert > ‘‘It’s not about me,’’ Crowley, 56, told his supporters. ‘‘It’s about America. I want nothing but the best for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. I want her to be victorious.’’
12:37 | Robert > He later played guitar with a band at his election night gathering, and dedicated the first song, Bruce Springsteen’s ‘‘Born to Run,’’ to Ocasio-Cortez.
12:37 | juju > DEDITATED WAM FOR UR SERBER? | https://youtu.be/LP0HYIkHs2Q
12:37 | tduds > good

12:38 | juju > https://goo.gl/gt5VRt
12:39 | Robert > nice!
13:04 | Lauren > yeah he is a good sounding dude
13:06 | jareds > With a name like Crowley, he has to be evil.
13:07 | jareds > "In our top story tonight, Mayor Crowley announced he has no plans to hault his practice of grinding up puppies to power his machine that arrests poor people. Film at 11."
13:08 | tduds > haha
13:31 | Lauren > what does the phrase "spin the cycles" mean
13:31 | Lauren > I tried to google it, and there were 3 results, and none were a thing.
13:31 | tduds > Same.
13:31 | Lauren > is my coworking just making shit up
13:31 | tduds > In what context is it used
13:32 | Lauren > basically "I'm working on something else, I can't spin the cycles at the moment"
13:32 | Lauren > so I'm pretty sure I know what he means by it, but. what.
13:32 | tduds > no clue
13:36 | Lauren > possibly an easier question: what's the deal with this ruling on unions? the article I saw that makes it sound like  it was that workers who don't want to join unions don't have to pay for union stuff
13:36 | Lauren > at first glance that seems fair? 
13:37 | Lauren > why should I pay membership fees for something I'm not a part of?
13:37 | tduds > Because they still benefit from the contract negotiations that the unions handle.
13:37 | Lauren > OK
13:37 | tduds > That's the fucked part
13:39 | Lauren > so it'd be like how if you're living with roommates and they care about AC and you don't, you still have to pay the usual share of the electric bill since you're benefitting from the AC, even if you didn't want to
13:40 | Lauren > er, I phrased that confusingly, that's the way it was. and now I could go "nah I'm paying a lower share"
13:40 | tduds > ehhhh 
13:40 | Lauren > I mean not exactly the same. but. I can't think of another real life thing.
13:41 | Lauren > I found another article that says non members already get reimbursed for stuff that's not collective bargaining, like supporting a political candidate
13:41 | tduds > A better parallel would be, say, splitting food costs.
13:41 | Lauren > why though? you can easily just not eat the food each other buys
13:42 | tduds > Hold on i'm trying to tihnk of how to elaborate
13:42 | Lauren > but if the AC is on in common areas, you can't not use it
13:42 | tduds > The weakness of that to me, is that you might see the AC as a bad thing.
13:42 | tduds > So you'd object to the AC being on.
13:42 | Lauren > okay yeah fair
13:43 | tduds > I don't think many people are demanding to be paid less
13:43 | tduds > I don't know how you'd go about it but this should open the door for union contracts to only apply to union members.
13:43 | Lauren > I think I was thinking about it the way I think of AC- I'd love to have it if it were free, and I like visiting people's houses who have it, but I don't care enough to pay for it myself
13:43 | tduds > Really the fix is to make a better case for union membership. People should *want* to join the union.
13:44 | Lauren > yeah I'm not clear on why someone wouldn't want to
13:44 | Lauren > I wish i COULD join one! we could demand legit 40 hour work weeks.
13:46 | Lauren > I guess there's the politics bit. If there were a computer programmers union, it might want to support brianna wu, and ugh
13:46 | Lauren > oh shit I actually got the right gamergate lady this time!
13:47 | tduds > And as a union member you could voice your objection openly!
13:47 | Lauren > yeah that's true
13:48 | Lauren > yeah I've got nothingg
13:49 | Lauren > if you disagree with a strike, you don't have to be part of it, right?
13:51 | Lauren > https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-generation-of-americans-is-entering-old-age-the-least-prepared-in-decades-1529676033?mod=trending_now_4

13:52 | Robert > tduds: finished that weed and wine article, good stuff!
13:52 | Lauren > oooo weed and wine? *scrolls back*
13:52 | tduds > A big part of the idea of unions is solidarity, so... you should support the Union even if you individually disagree, since the tacit agreement is that they will do the same in the reverse situation.
13:53 | Lauren > that's fair, plus it kinda seems unlikely that a member actually would disagree completely
13:53 | tduds > Framing it as "have to.." "need to.." "they..." is less accurate than "want to" "decide to" "we"
13:54 | tduds > Robert: yea i liked it!
13:54 | tduds > I'm glad she's getting more long form stories
13:54 | Lauren > oh is this by that person you know?
13:54 | tduds > My de-facto sister in law. yes
13:54 | Lauren > oh yep 
13:55 | Robert > https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evkeza/neo-nazi-who-killed-heather-heyer-in-charlottesville-was-just-charged-with-29-hate-crimes
13:55 | Lauren > I remember some other good article she did that you shared in here
13:55 | juju > https://goo.gl/VMBREx
13:55 | Lauren > 29 hate crimes!
13:55 | tduds > Yeah I share most of her stories
13:55 | tduds > outside of the day-to-day stuff
14:01 | Lauren > "He... sometimes hangs dried cow bladders on site to soak up “cosmic forces.”"
14:01  > Lauren blinks
14:01 | tduds > Robert: do you imagine any way that union contract benefits could be limited to union members only?
14:03 | tduds > Its all too easy for me to picture the side-effect of govt's just refusing to hire union members.
14:06 | Lauren > would that be hiring them directly, or more like hiring contractors that employ union members?
14:07 |@chewer > 29 hat crimes
14:07 | Lauren > how many were improper use of a fedora
14:07 |@chewer > MULTIPLE COUNTS OF SAYING 'MLADY WHEN WEARING FEDORA
14:07 | tduds > lol
14:07 | Lauren > oh and anthony kennedy is retiring
14:08 |@chewer > yo this chick from the bronx that just won sounds so badass
14:08 | tduds > Now?

14:08 | tduds > greeeeeeat
14:08 | Lauren > I'm confused because that's the url
14:08 | Lauren > but in the search results it said UPDATE: he announces retirement
14:08 |@chewer > 0 coverage from NYT and she still wins
14:09 | Lauren > so it must've been like, n the last few minutes
14:09 | tduds > ya
14:10 | Lauren > https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-justice-anthony-kennedy-announces-retirement-1530122570
14:10 | juju > https://goo.gl/uE9YM6
14:12 | tduds > :(
14:17 | Robert > super
14:17 | Lauren > also super! https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/1012036044714278912
14:17 | Robert > Why couldn't it at least have been Thomas?
14:18 | tduds > So, half-formed thought..
14:20 | tduds > First, a legal ruling isn't an endorsement. What I got from the bits of the recent Majority opinions is basically, the Constitution doesn't prohibit bad policy, but that doesn't mean it's good policy.
14:20 | tduds > Second, this sessions' rulings have been mostly permissive, rather than prohibitive or compulsory. So "you're allowed to..." vs. "You can't" or "You have to"
14:21 | tduds > So, like, there is tons of room to fight this through voting and legislation.
14:21 | tduds > And that's what I feel like is the most important message to scream fro mthe rooftops for the rest of the year.
14:21 | Robert > Yeah
14:22 | Robert > The only decision that I'm really disappointed in is the resdistricting one, all the others are relatively narrow and as you say permissive.
14:23 | tduds > Yeah.
14:23 | tduds > That was some shit.
14:23 | Robert > Especially in the Muslim ban, the majority opinion was pretty fucking critical of the policy but granted that it was within the executives' powers.
14:24 | tduds > right.
14:25 | Lauren > unrelated I guess I am in a twitter fight because I questioned why Boston raising parking ticket rates was such a big deal, when it is easy to avoid geting one
14:25 | Lauren > err facebook fight
14:25 | Lauren > apparently "everyone" gets tickets and if I haven't I'm probably lying or just wasn't caught
14:26 | Lauren > and forgetting about street cleaning is super easy
14:26 | Robert > ALSO let's not be too upset about Kennedy's retirement just yet. Remember when O'Connor retired and people flipped out about Roberts? He's been mostly pretty good.
14:26 | Lauren > I wonder if he retired now just to cause drama
14:26 | juju > Lauren: *diarrhea
14:27 | Lauren > as opposed to waiting until after the election
14:27 | Robert > Lauren: he's long stated he was going to retire during a conservative presidency and at the end of judicial term is the best time. He clearly didn't want to go through another judicial term.
14:27 | Lauren > ah ok
14:28 | Lauren > my thing is funnier, though.
14:28 | tduds > O great Molly's freaking out
14:28 | Robert > I'm somewhat of a SCOTUS geek/hobbyist. Kennedy *wanted* to retire in, like, 2014.
14:29 | Lauren > unrelated I finished the wine/weed article and who are these dumbasses who think I'm gonna stop drinking wine to smoke weed
14:29 | Lauren > they've clearly never met a white woman
14:29 | Robert > hahaha
14:29 | tduds > Do we really think Trump/McConnell want another Roberts? They want another Scalia.
14:30 | Robert > Scalias don't really exist anymore. Gorsuch is as close as they're gonna get, and from what I've seen of his court opinions he's pretty level.
14:30 | Robert > More level so far than Scalia was.
14:31 | tduds > True.
14:32 | tduds > Ugh, it's frustrating how apocalyptic molly can be about politics sometimes.
14:32 | Robert > Scalia was nearly an "activist judge" in a lot of ways. Gorsuch seems to be a genuine Constitutional originalist, which is a valid jurisprudential stance.
14:32 | tduds > Help me talk her off the cliff
14:32 | Lauren > propose!
14:32 | Robert > lol
14:32 | Robert > Yeah that'd do it
14:32 | Lauren > that'l distract her
14:33 | Robert > tduds: talk about Ocasio-Cortez and how great that is and how there are going to be dozens more just like her on ballots across the country come November.
14:34 | Lauren > show her that picture of how happy she is
14:34 | Lauren > after winning
14:34 | tduds > "And any challenges to future progressive policy will end up in a very anti-progressive supreme court" 
14:34 | tduds > She can be a little obstinate about bad news
14:35 | Robert > If you can say anything about this recent SCOTUS term it's that they are deeply adverse to interfering in policy.
14:35 | tduds > Yeah I kinda tried to say that
14:37 | Robert > That will probably be the biggest boon. Roberts is definitely and Gorsuch seems completely unwilling to counter anything that was duly passed through Congress.
14:39 | tduds > hmm
14:41 | Robert > So anyway, yeah I'm sorry to see Kennedy go because his opinions were usually very well reasoned and established in precedent rather than the whims of the executive or current events, but I'm not sure his replacement will be all that bad. We'll have to see.
14:41 | tduds > We will
14:42 | Robert > And remember even if confirmation goes before the midterms (which, frankly, I think it should) we have one more Democratic senator than we did for Gorsuch.
14:42 | Robert > Where's fred to see me be all reasonable and shit?!
14:42 | tduds > hm
14:44 | Robert > And none of this is to say I'm going to take my foot off the gas here or that we don't still have a LOT of work to do, neither is it diminishing the actual evils being perpetuated by this administration. But is it cataclysmic? I don't think so.
14:46 | Robert > O, I'm just reminded with Ocasio-Cortez how "populism" isn't a de faco dirty word. Her platform was very populist, though also practical.
14:47  > tduds nods
14:48 | Robert > I think particularly her style (and Warren, Brown, Duckworth, etc.) could really tap into that populist energy if they navigate it correctly and if Schumer stays the fuck out of the way.
14:48 | Robert > That last one is a tall order, I know.
14:49 | Robert > I think a lot of people feel betrayed by Trump, and the polls kinda bear that out. Of course, again, we have to wait and see.
14:49 | tduds > Yep
14:56 | tduds > https://twitter.com/mattkbh/status/1012041962789195777
14:56 | Robert > lol
15:20 | jareds > tduds: Nah, it's all hopeless, Molly's right.
15:22 | Lauren > TIL butthurt is one of those words that's actually offensive
15:23 | Lauren > I learned this because I used it in a reply to the dumbass about the parking ticket thing, and instead of just nicely telling me that's offensive, immediately decided I'm "prejudice or ignorant"
15:24 | Lauren > oh and my name is Laren
15:24 | jareds > I.... don't know what the parking ticket thing is, but something tells me that person would have been hostile anyway.
15:24 | Lauren > oh yeah
15:25 | Lauren > tldr Boston is raising parking ticket prices, by admittedly bizarrely high amounts
15:25 | jareds > So, was this on reddit or something?
15:25 | Lauren > I replied to someone's angry post about it wondering what was the big deal when you can easily just not park illegally
15:25 | Lauren > nah facebook
15:25 | jareds > Lauren: Are you reddit?
15:25 | Lauren > nope I'm just prejudice
15:25 | Lauren > all of it
15:26 | jareds > No we just need to find pride and then hook you guys up together.
15:26 | Lauren > yeah seriously
15:27 | Lauren > but yeah the OPbasically said everyone gets parking tickets and it's not dumb at all to fail to read signs and follow simple laws, I expressed bewilderment, then this other gu jumped in and... I don't even know?
15:28 | Lauren > first he said nice elaborate joke, and when I said I wasn't joking, he said he bets I'm fun at parties
15:30 | jareds > I think instead of just letting this go and continuing with your day, you should escalate. Like threaten him or something.
15:32 | Lauren > I replied to his attack by telling him it's a lot better to nicely tell someone their mistake and only be an asshole about it if they refuse to accept that they made one
15:32 | Lauren > and then told him that his way I still learned something but now I assume he just wants to pick fights and doesn't actually care about the LGBTQ community
15:33 | jareds > That was a good step one.
15:33 | jareds > But now gather up all of his wives, and then DON'T hold the door open for them.
15:34 | Lauren > yeah!
15:34 | Lauren > i wanted to steal your pride/prejudice joke but (a) felt like a hypocrite meanly pointing out a mistake he made that probably was just a typo and (b) figured he wouldn't even get the joke
15:42 | Lauren > ok whew I managed to work in a pride and prejudice joke
15:42 | Lauren > he just said ignorant (check mark) in response, and I said yeah about this one thing and presumably other terms as well, but I'm not a shitty person so when I learn about them I stop using them
15:42 | Lauren > but added that like prejudice, I am a fan of pride
15:49 | jareds > OK now leave a severed horse head on his bed.
15:50 | Lauren > oh I did that afer his first post
15:50 | Lauren > I could tell where it was all going
15:50 | Lauren > I used that site that's like the potato one and the glitter one, but they  anonymously send a severed horse head.
15:51 | Lauren > they were sold out of appaloosas
15:51 | Lauren > and budweiser sued them for offering clydesdales so they had to stop
15:53 | Lauren > that's why there was no budweiser clydesdale super bowl ad this year; until the lawsuit was decided they both had to stop using them
16:02 | Robert > missah: BMO Somerville fireworks are on the 28th
16:11 | tduds > What does 'actually offensive' mean
16:11 | tduds > as opposed to... what? hypothetically offensive? symbolically offensive?
16:14 | Robert > lol
16:14 | jareds > It's... I gget what was meant by it but it's still douchey. So the phrase "actually offensive" is a rebuttle to a non-overt assertion that something is, say, funny.
16:14 | Lauren > as opposed to "not offensive"
16:14  > Robert looks up "butthurt" in the etymological dictionary
16:15 | jareds > So Lauren would say butthurt, and the missing text is, "I know you think butthurt is funny but it's..."
16:15 | Robert > No results were found
16:15  > jareds looks up robert in the etymological dictionary
16:15 | jareds > The only result was 'butthurt'!?
16:16 | Robert > any time you want stud
16:16 | jareds > ;D
16:22 | tduds > I'd imagine calling a butthurt person butthurt would offend them. 
16:23 | tduds > Anyway the news has ruined my productivity for the day
16:29 | missah > Robert: ya! I got a phone call and email about it lol
16:35 | jareds > Wait, whose butt hurts?
16:38 | missah > mine
16:39 | jareds > ANd someone called you and emailed you about your sore butt?

17:15 | tduds > My first reaction was sort of a muted optimism, but the more i read into the scenarios the more that's fading
